# crypto_machine_learning

## Summary 
Here we are using unspervised machine learning in order to create a classification system for cryptocurrencies. Using only the 4 variables available to us (Algorith, Proof Type, Total Coin Supply, Total Coins Mined), we able able to reduce the data intpo 3 principle components, and seperate the vast amounts of crypto currenicies into 4 classes using a K-means clustering algorithm.
